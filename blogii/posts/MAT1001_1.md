## Derivatives

Derivatives demonstrate the slope k at a point of a graph.Certainly it is not defined as so in math.

### Definition of Derivatives

In modern mathematics, the derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x$ is defined as the following limit (if it exists):

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

This is often denoted as:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx}
$$

### Differentiablity

Derivatives do not always exist, and in the following situations $f(x)$ does not have a derivative at a point $x$.
- $x$ not in its domain
- $f(x)$ show discontinuity at $x$
- the $x$ happens to be a cusp or a corner
- at $x$ see a vertical tangent 
   
To conclude, to make a function differentiable at a certain point, it need to be smooth at the point, and the situations above aren't smooth.

Notice that the necessary and sufficient condition of $h \to x = l$ is $h \to 0^{-} = l$ and $h \to 0^{+} = l$, so as it for derivatives:

That is, the derivative exists at $x$ if and only if the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit are equal:

$$
\lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

If these two one-sided limits are not equal, the derivative at $x$ does not exist.

### Geometric Interpretation

The derivative at a point $x$ gives the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f(x)$ at that point. If the function is not smooth (for example, if there is a corner or cusp), the tangent line is not well-defined, and so the derivative does not exist there.


## Example
Lets see some examples.

#### Example 1
Consider the function $f(x) = |x|$. Let's check if it is differentiable at $x = 0$:

$$
\lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{|0 + h| - |0|}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{|h|}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{-h}{h} = -1
$$

$$
\lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{|0 + h| - |0|}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{|h|}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{h}{h} = 1
$$

Since the left and right limits are not equal, $f(x) = |x|$ is **not differentiable** at $x = 0$.
